Responsive Home page design. You get access to it only through authentication procedure, after a successful execution of it. You can log out from your account and being forced to change web-route from "/home" to "/". The page contains a catalog of films with an automatically generated route of each film. The catalog database is hosted on firebase and is fetched from there.
